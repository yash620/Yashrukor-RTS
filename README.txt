README for Yashrukor


Welcome to the readme for the Yashrukor. Read this and you will be on the path
to becoming a Yashrukor pro.

Step 1: Starting the game

On the main screen to start the game you are given 3 options:

1) New Game
2) Tutorial
3) Resume

New Game: Start a new game. 
Tutorial: Run the tutorial which will take you through the basics of the game.
 *If the tutorial is too hard, you suck at the game. (Looking at you Mr. Hansen)
Resume: Resume a paused game. 

If you are running the game for the first time, we reccomend you go through the tutorial.
But if you feel like you know the controls enough after reading this readme then
just hit New Game.

After clicking the New Game button you will be taken to a second screen where you will
be asked to select your hero. This unit will be you hero unit for this round. Each hero
has different advantages so select your heros carefully. 

Heroes:
	 * Beholder >> No abilites instead has VERY high health. But on the downside it has very low speed. This unit works
	 * 				as a tank. While it takes the damage the Player's other Units attack the enemy Units. 
	 * 				
	 * 				
	 * Slender >> Timer System: Blink: Able to teleport short distances timer.  Timer of 10 seconds
	 * 				Enable by pressing Z while a Slender is selected. 
	 * 
	 * 				Timer Blades Dance : Timer 10 seconds: Blinks to a target distance 
	 * 				and does damage in an area around the Hero. Timer of 20 seconds.
	 * 				Enable by pressing X key while Slender is selected. 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Finneo >>  Timer System: Warcry: Moralizes nearby allies and increases there attack, move speed, and
	 * 							attack speed. enable the pressing Z key when a Finneo is selected
	 * 
	 * 							Last Stand: Passive ability that activates when on very low health. Triples attack
	 * 							and doubles attack speed. 
	 * 						
	 * Prototype >> This is the most powerful unit in the game. It has no abilities but very high stats. The prototype has really high damage,
	 * 				attack speed,and movement speed. But since it has no abilites it is made for beginner players who are just getting used to
	 * 				the game. Expert players will are encouraged to use other Heros to have a challenge and explore their abilities. 
	 * 
	 * Tarba >> No Abilites but has stat advantages. It has a very high move speed but to balance this out it has a very low attack
	 * 			This Hero would be used by the player as a scouting Unit or for raids on enemy Builders. 
	 * 

For beginner we reccommend either Prototype or Finneo, for Prototype does not need any abilites 
to function and all the Finneo has is one active ability. 

After the Hero select screen you will be given the option to chose your difficulty.

Finally the game will start.

Step 2: Understanding the Game and the User Interface

To interact with the game the Player is give various user interface tools: 
	The HUD (Heads-Up Display) is the black border that surrounds the screen. In the top part of the HUD the resources are listed: Gold, Wood, Stone, Food
 	The bottom part of the HUD has the information for the Unit that is selected. For workers this is where the buildings they can build are listed. For Units
	and heroes this is where there health, attack damage, attack speed, and move speed are listed. 

	To select Units or Buildings the Player has to left click and drag his making a selection box around the Builings/Units they want to select. In selection Units
	have priority over Buildings. 
	
	To move Units select the Unit and right click at the position where the Units is to move. 

	To attack a specific enemy unit select the Unit and then right click on the enemy unit.

	To have a unit move in attack mode position mouse over the point to move to then press A.
		Attack mode means while moving if a Unit sees an enemy unit the Unit will stop moving to the point and go attack the enemy Unit.

	To create Units from the their respective buildings press the space bar. 

	The ability buttons for Heroes are Z and X. To know which button each ability is refer back to the Heroes description in Step 1.

	On the bottom right corner of the screen is the minimpa. This minimap eneable to view the whole map at one time. The minimap is a smaller version of the entire map.
	After selecting a Unit you can also move the unit by right clicking on the minimap. 
	
	To pause the game press f10 and you will be taken back to the Starting Menu. The press the resume button to start the game again. 
 

The currencies of this game are the 4 resources listed at the top of the HUD: Gold, Wood, Stone, Food. 
Builings need wood, stone and gold to be constructed. Units need food and gold to be trained. 

Buildings are the places where Units are trained and resources are collected. 
Buildings: 
	Farm
	  Collects Food
	Quarry
	  Collects Stone
	Lumber Mill
      	  Collects Wood
	Town Hall
	  Creates Workers
	Barracks
	  Creates Swordsmem
	Archer Range
	  Creates Archers
	Stable
	  Creates Knights
	Church
	  Creates Healers
	Tower
	  A Building built to draw damage away from main production buildings.


Units are the different objects that move around the game world and interact with each other.
Units:
	Hero: Each Player gets one Hero and when Hero dies it respawns near the Player's Town Hall. The details of 
	      Heroes are listed in Step 1.
	Archer: Archers are trained from the archery range and are the ranged units of the game. Archers have low health, decent attack, and medium move speed.
		When kept at a range they can counter Swordsman and even Knights. 
	Healer: Healers are the only Units in the game that can heal other Units. Instead of attacking, the Healer has the ability to heal friendly Units. Healers 
		are trained from the Church. 
	Swordsman: Swordsman are the grunt Units of the game. They are melee Units so they have a low attack range and they have decent health and attack, and low move speeed.
		   Swordsman are trained from the Brracks. 
	Knight: Are the elite non-hero Units of the game. They have high attack, health, and move speed compared to other Units but they are still weaker than Heros.
		Knight are created from the Stable
	Worker: Workers are the basis of the game. They have the ability to construct and repair buildings. Workers can be created from the Town Hall. 

Step 3: Playing the Game
We suggest you play the game with a mouse. 

When you start the game you have 1 Worker, 1 Hero (depends on which Hero you chose), 1 Town Hall, 1 Lumber Mill, 1 Farm.
We suggest that you build a barracks first since you are given buildings to bring in supplies. Then use this barracks to create Units to defend yourself.  

You are also unable to see much of the map. This is due to the fact that your Units don't see this are of the map. After you have discovered an area it will still appear 
black but this time if you scroll to the area you will be able to see the buildings that were at that position when you explored that area.

The point of the game is create as large of an army as you can and use this army and destroy all of the enemy's buildings. If you lose all your buildings then you lose the game.
The AI prioritizes attacking buildings over Units. 

GOOD LUCK AND HAVE FUN.
